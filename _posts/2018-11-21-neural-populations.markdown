When multiple stimuli that overlap in their neural representation are simultaneously encoded in the population, biases in the read-out emerge.
To study the origin of the bias, a framework based on Gaussian Processes is developed that allows an accurate calculation of the estimate distributions of maximum likelihood decoders.
