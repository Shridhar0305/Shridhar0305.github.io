Humans and other animals have a natural ability to identify useful past experiences. How can machines do the same? We present "memorable experiences" to identify a machineâ€™s relevant past experiences and understand its current knowledge. The approach is based on a new notion of duality which is an extension of similar ideas used in kernel methods. 
<!-- We demonstrate the application of memorable examples as a tool to understand knowledge learned by several types of machine-learning models. -->
