This work incorporates the  structure of graphical models into neural processes. This leads to aggregation strategies in which context points are appropriately weighted, generalizing a recent proposal by Volpp et al., [2020]. The weighting further reveals an interpretation of each point, which we refer to as the neural sufficient statistics.
